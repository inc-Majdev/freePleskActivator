# Free Plesk Activator

Welcome, Plesk Users! The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the management of multiple servers using an existing license. This solution is entirely open-source and is devoid of any advertisements. Feel free to seamlessly integrate it into your server environment to activate your Plesk instance. As an avid Plesk Panel user myself, I am committed to providing continuous updates to the license file. In the rare event of oversight on my part, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email. It's worth noting that this solution refrains from adding cron jobs to your server or running in the background, ensuring its reliability.
